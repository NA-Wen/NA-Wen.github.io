Holding a strong conviction that "Exploring the essence of intelligence will broaden the boundaries of cognition and contribute to a better world," I am currently strategizing to commence a Ph.D. journey specializing in NLP/LLM/ML/DL. My goal is to advance my academic pursuits, with the anticipated initiation of this endeavor in the fall of 2025.
