  My name is Yufan Dang(Yesfir). I'm a undergrad at **Tsinghua university**(2021-2025) , double major in **MPS(math and physics science) & Software**. Now as a research intern at THUNLP, I'm learning around LLM & agent, and engaged in [ChatDev](https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev) as a main contributor. \\
  \\
  Holding a strong conviction that "Exploring the essence of intelligence will broaden the boundaries of cognition and contribute to a better world" I am currently strategizing to commence **a Ph.D. journey specializing in NLP/LLM/ML/DL**. My goal is to advance my academic pursuits, with the anticipated initiation of this endeavor **in the fall of 2025**.

Other facts around me:
 - üßÄ I have a passion for sharing _tech blogs_ on my [website](https://na-wen.github.io/year-archive/), where I discuss the courses I am currently enrolled in and share insights into cutting-edge papers and news.
 - üèê Aside from research and tons of math and physics, I love volleyball / gym workingout / tennis / hiking ......
