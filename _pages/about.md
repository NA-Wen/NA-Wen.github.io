  My name is Yufan Dang (ÂÖö‰ΩôÂá°). I'm a undergrad at **Tsinghua university**(2021-2025) , double major in **MPS(math and physics science) & Software**. Now as a research intern at THUNLP, I'm learning around LLM & agent, and engaged in [ChatDev](https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev) as a main contributor. 

  <!-- Holding a strong conviction that "Exploring the essence of intelligence will broaden the boundaries of cognition and contribute to a better world" I am currently strategizing to commence **a Ph.D. journey specializing in NLP/LLM/ML/DL**. My goal is to advance my academic pursuits, with the anticipated initiation of this endeavor **in the fall of 2025**.\\ -->
  
  I have a passion for sharing _tech blogs_ on my [blog site](https://cuddly-athlete-ff1.notion.site/NA-Wen-s-blog-6efd65e06b934c369ba0f0ad7901c4f8), where I discuss the courses I am currently enrolled in and share insights into cutting-edge papers and news.mAside from research and tons of math and physics, I love volleyball / gym workingout / tennis / hiking and I'm a violin enthusiast.

**Research Interest:**
  <details>
  <summary>
  LLM agents ü§ñ </summary>
I'm focused on developing LLM-based autonomous agents capable of effectively and efficiently tackling multi-step and complex tasks. Previously, my focus was primarily on software development, but now I'm eager to explore broader applications. Particularly, I'm intrigued by the concept of LLM-based multi-agent systems:

1. **Understanding Multi-Agent Systems:**
   - **Definition:** Multi-agent systems involve multiple autonomous agents interacting to achieve individual or collective goals. There might be scaling laws or convergence phenomena in multi-agent systems, depending on the specific dynamics and characteristics of the agents involved.
   
2. **Leveraging the Potential of Multi-Agent Systems:**
   - **Choosing Scenarios:** Selecting appropriate scenarios for utilizing multi-agent systems could include simulation environments, software development tasks, or recreational activities.
   - **Optimizing Organization:** Efficient organization of the multi-agent system involves structuring roles, responsibilities, and interactions to maximize performance.
   - **Communication Strategies:** Finding optimal communication methods between agents, such as using instructor-assistant paradigms, structured languages like JSON, or developing agents' own communication protocols.
   - **Enhancing Cooperation:** Improving agents' abilities to cooperate within the multi-agent system through methods like experiential co-learning and fine-tuning model parameters.
   - **Exploring Agent Societies:** Investigating parallels between multi-agent systems and human societies, and understanding how the process of constructing an agent's world parallels evolutionary processes observed in animals.
   
3. **Impact of Multi-Agent Systems on Human Interaction:**
   - When interacting with humans, multi-agent systems can enhance various aspects of human life, such as:
     - Facilitating collaborative problem-solving.
     - Providing personalized assistance and support.
     - Offering entertainment and enrichment through interactive experiences.

**Learning Theory / Reinforcement Learning / Machine Learning üé®** </summary>

Learning ability stands as the true differentiator between intelligence and any other attribute. There is ample room for exploration in this domain, particularly in:

- **Learning Theory / Machine Learning:** Continuously advancing our understanding of how learning occurs and devising strategies to optimize learning processes.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Harnessing the power of reinforcement learning algorithms to enable agents to learn from interactions with their environment and make informed decisions.
