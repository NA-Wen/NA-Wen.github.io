  My name is Yufan Dang (ÂÖö‰ΩôÂá°). I'm a undergrad at **Tsinghua university**(2021-2025) , double major in **MPS(math and physics science) & Software**. Now as a research intern at THUNLP, I'm learning around LLM & agent, and engaged in [ChatDev](https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev) as a main contributor. 

  <!-- Holding a strong conviction that "Exploring the essence of intelligence will broaden the boundaries of cognition and contribute to a better world" I am currently strategizing to commence **a Ph.D. journey specializing in NLP/LLM/ML/DL**. My goal is to advance my academic pursuits, with the anticipated initiation of this endeavor **in the fall of 2025**.\\ -->
  
  I have a passion for sharing _tech blogs_ on my [blog site](https://cuddly-athlete-ff1.notion.site/NA-Wen-s-blog-6efd65e06b934c369ba0f0ad7901c4f8), where I discuss the courses I am currently enrolled in and share insights into cutting-edge papers and news. Aside from research and tons of math and physics, I love volleyball üèê/ gym workingout üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è/ tennis üéæ/ hiking üèûÔ∏è and I'm a violin enthusiast.
